# Binary-Classification--Titanic-
Objective:

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster or not.

Dataset:

The dataset contains information about each passenger, including whether they survived (target variable) and various features such as ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, passenger fare, cabin number, and the port of embarkation.
Features:

Survival (Target Variable): 0 indicates No (did not survive), and 1 indicates Yes (survived).
Pclass (Ticket class): 1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class.
Sex: Male or Female.
Age: Age in years.
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard.
Ticket: Ticket number.
Fare: Passenger fare.
Cabin: Cabin number.
Embarked (Port of Embarkation): C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton.

1. Importing and preprocessing data:

Import the necessary libraries (as you've already done in your code snippet).
Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Check for missing values and handle them (impute or drop).
Convert categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding for 'Sex' and 'Embarked').
Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).

2. Data Cleaning:

Further handle missing values if needed.
Handle outliers and anomalies in the data.
Check for any inconsistencies or errors in the data.

3. Exploring data:

Explore the distribution of each feature.
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (e.g., survival rates based on different features).
Analyze summary statistics of the dataset.

4. Dashboard:

Create an interactive dashboard using tools like Plotly or Dash.
Include visualizations and summaries of key insights from your data exploration.
Allow users to interactively explore the data and understand patterns.

5. Classification:

Dummies:
If needed, create dummy variables for categorical features.

Logistic Regression:
Train a logistic regression model using the processed data.
Evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Decision Tree Classifier:
Train a decision tree classifier.
Evaluate its performance.

Random Forest:
Train a random forest classifier.
Evaluate its performance.

XGBoost Classifier:
Train an XGBoost classifier.
Evaluate its performance.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
Train a neural network with appropriate architecture.
Evaluate its performance.

Additional Considerations:

Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation to obtain a more robust estimate of model performance.
Model Comparison: Compare the performance of different models to choose the best one for your task.
Interpretability: Consider the interpretability of your models, especially if you need to explain them to non-technical stakeholders
